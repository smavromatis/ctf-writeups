## Did it work?

If you are reading this on the live website, the webhook was successfully triggered, and the two repositories have communicated! 

The content on the left side of the `smavromatis.github.io` website was fetched automatically from the external `ctf-writeups` repository when it issued the dispatch signal via GitHub Actions.
